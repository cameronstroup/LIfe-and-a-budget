# Life-and-a-budget

## Description
A simple budgeting website that allows the user to manually input the name, the budget, and actual amount of their income, expenses, and savings. The homepage allows the user to login or go to the main budgeting page if they are already logged in.

Live Application: https://agile-headland-32063.herokuapp.com/

## Built With
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Dotenv
* Sequelize
* Handlebars
* Chart.js
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Installation
The user can either visit the live application posted above, or clone the code to see it on a localhost. If using a local server, must have MySQL installed along with an account. The user must then install the npm packages by running 'npm i'. The user will then have to create an '.env' file and fill in their MySQL credentials and the name of the database (LIfe_and_a_budget). If the user wants to see what the website will look like with data filled in, need to run 'npm run seeds' and then to start the server 'npm start' in the terminal.

## Usage
After turning on the server with 'npm start' the user can then use their browser and type 'http://localhost:3002/' to be taken to the homepage of the application. The user will then have to create an account and/or login to see the budget page. They then can add/update/delete any rows from any of the three tables (Income, Expenses, or Savings).
